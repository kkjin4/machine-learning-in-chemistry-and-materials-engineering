    "1. Plot the square root of the electric field $\\left(\\sqrt{F}\\right)$ versus the mobility $\\left(\\mu_H\\right)$ for data points only at temperatures of 173, 273, and 343 K. Plot all three on the same plot and include a legend denoting which points are at which temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Perform a multi-variable linear regression to predict $\\log_{10}(\\mu_{H})$ from the variables $\\sqrt{F} / T^{2}$ and $1/T^{2}$ using $\\textit{all}$ of the data (i.e., data at all temperatures should be used to fit the linear regression). Create a copy of the same plot from part 1 (again only temperatures 173, 273, and 343 K), and now add lines of best fit from this linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Find the $R^2$ value of each of the 3 linear fits described above. ($\\textbf{Note:}$ This can be done with the function sklearn.metrics.r2_score(). You can use Google to find the documentation of this function if you are unfamiliar.) Clearly report the $R^2$ values of each temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Again perform a multi-variable linear regression to predict $\\log_{10}(\\mu_{H})$ from the variables $\\sqrt{F} / T^{2}$ and $1/T^{2}$ using $\\textit{only data at or above a temperature of 273 K}$. Create a copy of the same plot from part 2 (only temperatures 173, 273, and 343 K), and add lines of best fit from this linear regression model. Report $R^2$ values for each fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Pick a new temperature besides 173, 273, or 343 K. Repeat the analysis from part 4, with the following changes:\n",
    "    - Only plot the data and linear fit of your chosen temperature\n",
    "    - Use a different range of 7 temperatures to train the linear model (besides those at 273 K or above - for example, you could train the model on temperatures at or below 243 K)\n",
    "    - Report what temperature range you used for training and the $R^2$ value of the fit\n",
    "    - Repeat this 3 more times with different temperature ranges (you should have 4 total temperature ranges, plots, and $R^2$ values\n"
