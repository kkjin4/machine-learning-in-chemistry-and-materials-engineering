    "1. Extract the 'CharacteristicName' equal to 'Nitrate' from the exp_data. Find the number of data points 'n_e' (note, 'len(x)' gives the length of an array 'x').\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate a probability density function for the distribution of nitrate concentrations using the histogram properties ('x0', 'xf', and 'n_bin') used in the exercise. Show that this histogram does not get agreement between $\\langle c \\rangle$ and $\\langle c^{2} \\rangle$ calculated from the data and from the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vary the maximum value in the histogram 'xf' and the number of bins 'n_bin' until we get agreement (precision of 1 decimal place) between $\\langle c \\rangle$ and $\\langle c^{2} \\rangle$ calculated from the data and from the histogram. Note, the maximum value 'xf' should be larger than the largest value in the set (note, 'np.max(x)' gives the largest value in the array 'x').\n",
