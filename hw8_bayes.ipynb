    "6. **THOUGHT QUESTION:** In the class example applying Bayes' Theorem to COVID-19 testing, you saw that due to an imbalance in the prior, even a low false positive rate can result a large portion of positive tests returned from healthy individuals. One way to reduce the false positive rate would be to increase the threshold required by the test to return a positive result â€“ however, this comes at the expense of an increased false negative rate. Often times when designing tests there is a trade-off between false positive and false negative rates. Describe a scenario where you would accept a higher false positive rate for a lower false negative rate. Describe another scenario where you would accept a higher false negative rate for a lower false positive rate."
